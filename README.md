# GBA Cross Compiling Libraries
This repository serves both as documentation and as a library for building GCC
to cross compile to the GBA. At the moment, it's quite minimal. It only supports
C and Assembly, it doesn't support constructors or destructors, and it doesn't
even have a C standard library. Nonetheless, it can compile simple games, such
as the ones developed in Georgia Tech's CS 2110.
